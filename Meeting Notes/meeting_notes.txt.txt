[********** Meeting 1/14/2016 **********]
*****************************************

Key Points:
* color
* tecture
* lighting

People feel better when they are in the loop

Meet with Perkowski every week
Meet with Intel every 3 weeks

Test on different floors (e.g. colored carpet, tiles)
Test using different lights
Use paper, boxes, circles
Test OpenCV 2D methods
Test PCL 3D methods

Test how often image recognition is correct and how often
object is mistaken for another object? (confusion matrix)

Dilation, closing, hardware and software transforms, edge detection.
NOTE: Lighting conditions are very important!

NOTE: Change "software" to "toolkit"
NOTE: Do not need to define "cheap"

Target Hardware: Nook (2 to 5 frames per second)
distance: 0.6m to 2.5m
keep ROS in mind for the future
* Compare RealSense R200 to Kinect

From sponsor meeting: "Build a good implementation that uses a 
                       minimum amount of compute power"

A MAX 97% success rate (this would be phenomenal)
Look into OpenCV GPU offload

Meeting: Perkowski wants to be at all of are meetings
  Thursday 10 - 12pm
  
To-Do by next week:
  Take 200+ pictures from realsense camera for data
  Two sets of data, one on carpet, another on tiled (reflective) floor
  create a confusion matrix
  Have a working demo in two weeks
  Look into Agile method
  
Questions:
  What type of lighting are we allowed to use? (structured or non-structured)
  What type of objects?
  what type of surface?
  Should the software be capable of working in untested rooms?
  Are objects always on the floor, or can they be objects in a referigerator?
  What is the target environment? (office, factory, home, retirement home)
  What should the vision software return? (3D box, object recognition)
  What are our MUSTS? (expected minimum)
  What are the expected deliverables?
  What are their other requirements?
  Is doxigen ok for documentation?
  Should large objects like chairs, cats, dogs be recognized?
  What languages should we support?
  What are the requirements?
  What library should we use? (PCL OpenCV)
  How often does the sponsor want to meet?
