This folder contains the beginnings of my work using a genetic algorithm 
to find the best combination of parameters for a pcl program. A class
diagram can be found in the diagrams folder. Diagram was made using 
Violet UML Editor.

The code found in include/ and src/ are barbones at the moment. I will update 
the code when I feel sufficient progress has been made.
