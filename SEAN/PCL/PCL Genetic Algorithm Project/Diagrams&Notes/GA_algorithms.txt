This file contains algorithms for my Genetic Algorithm.  algorithms will be
written in pseudo code.

ALGORITHM: Test GA
generate new population with random binary strings
add population to generation 1
set execution time and validity of population
set fitness of population
update population statistics
WHILE (you want to continue with more generations)
	generate new population based on previous population
	add population to next generation
	set execution time and validity of population
	update population statistics
	ask user if they want to create a new generation
END WHILE
