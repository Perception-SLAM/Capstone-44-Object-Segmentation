As of 5/23/2016, I have placed this project on hold due to the capstone project
coming to an end.

The most recent code can be found in VS2013_PCL_GA_PROJECT.

This folder contains the beginnings of my work using a genetic algorithm 
to find the best combination of parameters for a pcl program. A class
diagram can be found in the diagrams folder. Diagram was made using 
Violet UML Editor.

The code found in include/ and src/ are barbones at the moment.
The /diagrams folder holds some of my thoughts and the initial plan 
for a GUI using Qt.
