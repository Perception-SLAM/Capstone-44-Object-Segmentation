The results of the meeting with the other capstone team:

They would like to receive points as 3 floats. They need 1 for the center of mass of the object. They want 8 points to be the form of the bounding box data.

They will be using 3 colored markers for the hand to determine orientation, they also need 1 marker for the elbow so that we can send them data about the presence of the elbow.

They need the distance between the hand and the object.

They need 1 flag for the arm within the camera's view and 1 flag for the elbow being in the camera's view.

They would like to know the angle and height of the plane. Apparently a vector starting at the surface of the plane and normal to the plane is sufficient.
